# STOCK-FORECAST-FOR-BANKS
### Project Aim: Here we aimed to forecast the stock price of all banks by using time series analysis on given data set. In given data set 5711 observations and 12 variables has given to us. We have provided 4 companies stock prices. In stock price an open, high, low and close, volume chart (also OHLC) is type of stock value that typically used for illustrate movements in the price of financial tool over time periods. By using different time series model we forecast the stock price for all banks. Before start the time series analysis, we have to know about stock. So in below we can see the stock trends behaviors:
In stock:
•	Open value- price when stock opened day
•	High value- High price of the stock on day
•	Low value- Low price of the stock on day
•	Close value- The price when stock closed and last price of stock.
•	Volume: Stock price 
Time series forecast for Banks
We have installed the required library to perform time series analysis. We have converted Year and day columns in Data format. Then we have forecast the close price of stock for banks by using different time series model like Arima, garch, ets etc. 

#### Conclusion:
Time series analysis result designate that:
•	Different time series algorithms has performed differently on different stock of banks.
•	The model which get trained in a smooth period and predict well in shock period may be considered for future predictions of banks.
•	For trader it can be better to watch stock prices those stock prices (previous day), as well, which will influence the movement of the bank stock. 
•	Here we have applied 4+ time series model to check the accuracy of each model, then we have found Arima and Garch model forecast better than other forecast model.
